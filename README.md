Project: Corona Virus Analysis

I just wrapped up an in-depth analysis project on COVID-19 data using SQL.

Quick Overview
Project 1: Corona Virus Analysis

Tools Used:

üíª MySQL: For analysis
üìä PowerPoint: For presentation
üé• OBS Studio: For video presentation
‚úÇÔ∏è VSDC Video Editor: For video editing

Using the "Reference File for Corona data" with 16 questions, I performed detailed analysis by writing SQL queries.

A huge thank you to the Mentorness team for this opportunity! Through this task, I enhanced my data analysis and presentation skills. I also learned how to create and edit informative videos.

Q9. Find maximum values of confirmed, deaths, recovered per year

Q10. The total number of case of confirmed, deaths, recovered each month

Q11. Check how corona virus spread out with respect to confirmed case (Eg.: total confirmed cases, their average, variance & STDEV )

Q12. Check how corona virus spread out with respect to death case per month (Eg.: total confirmed cases, their average, variance & STDEV )

Q13. Check how corona virus spread out with respect to recovered case (Eg.: total confirmed cases, their average, variance & STDEV )

Q14. Find Country having highest number of the Confirmed case

Q15. Find Country having lowest number of the death case
